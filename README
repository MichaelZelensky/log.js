log.js

Cross-browser wrapper for window.console object.

If you try to use console.log() in Internet Explorer version 9 or less, it will throw out an error and make you script stop. The script fixes this problem and makes console.log() usage cross-browser. It will not log messages in IE9 or less, because there is no technical way for that, but your JS will also not crash because of using console object.

Usage

Include JSLog by adding this line to your html HEAD section:
<script src="js/log.js" type="application/javascript"></script>
In your JS code:
JSLog.log('This is console log message')
JSLog.error('This is console error message')
etc.
Open your browser Developer Tools console and see the output!
